# LAMP Stack Implementation in AWS

The LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack implementation in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment is the main objective of this project. A well-liked open-source software stack called the LAMP stack is used to serve dynamic webpages and web applications.

#### Technology Stack
A technology stack, sometimes referred to as a software stack or solution stack, is a group of software frameworks and technologies that are used in together to create and maintain a certain application or system. The infrastructure and functionality for a software solution are provided by a group of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, operating systems, and other tools that cooperate with one another.

Each layer in a typical technology stack has a distinct function to fulfil during the software development process.

# Introduction
In this project, I built a working web server environment using the LAMP stack in AWS, and provided a step-by-step guide for setting up a fully functional web server environment.  The Linux operating system, Apache as a web server, MySQL as a database management system, and PHP as a server-side scripting language make up the LAMP stack.

I learnt how to install and configure the required software components, provision and configure AWS EC2 instances, and deploy a test web application in this project.


## Project Overview
The following steps are included in the project:

* Configuring an AWS account and login credentials.
* Creating an Amazon EC2 instance with a Linux operating system.
* Setting up and configuring Apache as a web server.
* MySQL database server installation and security.
* Setting up PHP to operate with Apache.
* To validate the LAMP stack implementation, a sample web application is deployed.
* Testing and confirming the functionality of the web application.

Each step is thorough with instructions and configuration requirements to ensure a successful LAMP stack implementation in AWS.


## Technologies Used
The following technologies are used in the project:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS): EC2, VPC, IAM
* Linux-based operating system (i used Ubuntu).
* Apache HTTP Server
* MySQL Database Management System
* PHP server-side scripting language

Before beginning the setup procedure, confirm that you have  AWS account and access credentials.
